theme: minima 


# Welcome to my blog folks

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Frontend-Web Development.

I am Unaware how to change the Theme to Minima.

The description in the Bot does not help, due to the unexpected merge conflict (I guess) .

Cannot fnd the socalled edit Mode in the Pull-Request-description (as advised by the BOT ). 

Thus I cannot perform the next step.

As this seems to again become just a loss of time, 
Searching and not knowing, 
without results: I will stop learning now. 

Against my will!
